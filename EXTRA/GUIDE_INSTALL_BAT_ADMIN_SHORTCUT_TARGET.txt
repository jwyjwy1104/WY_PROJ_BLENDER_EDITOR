			Project install.bat file guide
================================================================================
Description: 
   This file is to summarize the steps generating the main installation 
   batch file to run in administrator mode, but when batch file is ran in admin 
   mode the directory changes to "C:/Windows/System32" automatically, this 
   guide also explains how to change directory when batch file is executed in 
   admin mode.

0) Main project installation shortcut files:
    - install_win10_x64

   Note: This files are the shortcutc to the main batch file inside EXTRA 
	 folder.
	 This shortcuts files are created to execute the main batch files in
	 administrator mode in order to access the system environment PATH 
	 variables directly.
   
1) How to create this shortcuts:
    Purpose) 
       - Run batch file in administrator mode.
       - Run batch file in administrator mode but in the same directory
	 instead of C:/Windows/System32.

    A) Right click on the batch file (eg. install.bat) 
       --> Send to --> Desktop (Shortcut)
    B) Can see the shortcut file is generated in the Desktop 
       (eg. install.bat - Shortcut)
    C) Right click the shortcut file (eg. install.bat - Shortcut)
       --> Properties --> Advanced --> Check "Run as administrator" option.
       
       Now this shortcut file executes the connected batch file in 
       administrator mode which pops the User Account Control window
       asking "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to you computer?"
       If user click "yes" then the batch file is executed in admin mode,
       if user click "no" then the batch file terminates.

    D) But the problem here is that when batch file is executed in admin mode
       the current working directory is automatically changed to 
       "C:/Windows/System32" which can causes errors so I needed to change the 
       directory manualy:
       
       Right click the shortcut file (eg. install.bat - Shortcut)
       --> Target section 
       --> Change the code:
       (eg. C:\Users\Nickj\Desktop\WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR\EXTRA\	
	    install_win10_x64.bat)
       --> Into this code:
       (eg. C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k cd C:\Users\Nickj\Desktop\
	    WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR\EXTRA && install_win10_x64.bat)

    *****IMPORTANT*****
    Change shortcut property "Target" to:
    C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k cd C:\Users\Nickj\Desktop\WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR\EXTRA && install_win10_x64.bat
    

    E) This way even though the batch file is executed in admin mode, the 
       batch file is executed in directory indicated in the target cd section
       (eg. cd C:\Users\Nickj\Desktop\WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR\EXTRA)
