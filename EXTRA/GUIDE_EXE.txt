			Create project setup.exe guide
================================================================================
Description:
   This file is the summarized steps generating project setup.exe with ALZip
   self-extractor, also the steps executing the installation batch file when 
   project folder is self-extracted.

0) ALzip must be installed: http://www.altools.com/altools/alzip.aspx

1) Compress the project folder by right clicking the project folder 
   --> Send to --> Compressed (zipped) folder.

2) Double click to open the ZIP file through ALZip
   --> Action --> ALZip Self-Extractor (EXE) 

3) Implement the Create Self-Extractor (SFX) window:
   Example:
   --> SFX Title		      	: WY_PROJ_BLENDER_DIRECTX
   --> Set Default Folder To Extract 	: C:\Users\Nickj\Desktop
       (Can leave it blank)
   --> Task to Run After Extraction	:
       *****IMPORTANT*****
       This command is to execute the main project install batch file 
       after the project is self extracted.
       
   Command for batch file run in admin mode:
       cmd.exe /c runas /noprofile /user:%computername%\%username% "cmd /k cd %cd%\WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR\ && install_win10_x64_admin.bat"
       *******************

   Note: This command is necessary because the ALZip self extractor 
	 "Task to Run After Extraction" option need to specify the path of 
         the files to execute after the extraction. But the given examples 
         from online and documents are all about executing .exe file
         (eg. cmd.exe, notepad.exe), no examples are found executing shell 
         commands through this option. After debugging, I found a good 
         solution to execute the batch file inside the extracted folder
	 by using following mechanisms:
	     A) Open a command line and append the commands using /c option:
		- cmd.exe /c
	     B) But I need to run the batch file in admin mode so the 
	  	install batch file can access the system environment PATH
 		directly to append path values to set up this project.
		- runas /noprofile /user:%computername%\%username%
	     C) Navigate to the current project directory which project is 
		self-extracted:
	       	- cd %cd%\WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR\ 
	     D) Navigates to the current directory where self-extration is 
		done and naviagte inside extracted project directory 
		to run the batch file in admin mode:
		- "cmd /k cd %cd%\WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR\ 
	     E) Executes the install batch file after navigating to the 
		project folder by appending batch file execution command 
		using "&&" operator:	
		- && install_win10_x64.bat"

	 (eg. The process terminated right away without any error messages 
              when "make" was not installed in the system and is called 
	      in the batch file)

4) Double click the .exe generated.
   	eg. WY_PROJ_BLENDER_DIRECTX.exe
5) Specify location to extract(eg. C:\Users\Nickj\Documents\) 
   --> Click "Extract"
6) Will automatically open a terminal and asks for current user password to
   provide admin priviledge --> Input user password.
7) Install batch is executed with admin priviledge --> Wait until process is 
   done --> Project setup complete.

================================================================================
Expected) 
  Project extracted --> Input password --> install_win10_x64.bat is ran
  --> Project ready to be tested --> Project ready to use.
