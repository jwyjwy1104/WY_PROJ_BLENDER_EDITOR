Project name: 
    - WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR.
    - Project was originally brought from 
      [ BlenderExporterImporterProj_ver0055 ].

Objectives:
    - Understanding of game editor framework and mechanism by creating 
      custom exporter and importers using Blender API to export and import
      Blender mesh, material, armature and animation to files and load 
      them to my custom engine.  

Staff:
    - Junior programmer : Nick Jang.

Old project: [BlenderExporterImporter]

How to run:
    WARNING:
	The project is incompleted due to creating tools as sub projects
	supporting mesh and material exporter developing, where one sub
	project is a Python test case generator with OAuth which generates 
	the Python unit test cases using the test case data retrieved from 
	Google Spreadsheet and another one is a HTML time report dashboard
	generator with Python which also using the data retrieved from 
	Google Spreadsheet using OAuth.

	But can test the tool created as sub projects of the mesh and material
	exporter by following the user guide in each sub projects directory
	inisde "MESH_MAT_EXPORTER/" which test case generator sub project 
	is called "OAuthTestGenerator" and the time report dashboard sub 
 	project is called "OAuthTimeReportDashboard"

Note: 
    - This project was originally developed as project name 
      [ BlenderExporterImporterProj ] where all the document 
      are combined within the main DirectX 12 project's document 
      [ WY_PROJ_DIRECTX_12_WIN32 ] so the HQ and the detail document is 
      combined inside the DirectX 12 project's HQ document 
      [ https://docs.google.com/document/d/
	1B_V9Rhkh17cy4JNlMqg02RBvVt1FgdOZuMK9LYTWjt0/edit ]

    - This project was originally developed without specific and 
      separated stand alone documents, refactoring, API, 
      diagrams and test cases, which was called [ BlenderExporterImporterProj ]
      where I continue to developing multiple 
      custom exporter and importers such as for meshes, 
      materials, armatures and animations.
