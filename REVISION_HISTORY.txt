	in one project folder

201710042230	ver0013		
	Test case generator complete in folder 
	"mesh_mat_exporter\OAuthTestGenerator" can now generate and execute 
	the test case using test case data from Google Spreadsheet and 
	print the result output to the local text file and also generate the 
	Pydoc API document before executing the unit test cases complete.
201710050100	ver0014		
	Organizing local documents, readme, user guide and revision history files.
201710052030	ver0015		
	WYCoordsys::__init__, WYCoordsys::__str__ and WYCoordsys::export_xu_yf

201710051430
201710060230 	ver0016 	
	OAuth test case generator tool finished, WYCoordsys unit test cases 
	generated and executed with the OAuth test case generator tool.
201710061630	ver0017		
	Local documents organized + Savepoint before Sam.
201710062250	ver0018		
	Savepoint with Sam.

201710162300	ver0022		
	Savepoint before adding install.bat file.
201710170130	ver0023		
	Install.bat file importing Blender as Python module done.
201710171900	ver0024		
	Install.bat file download and generating Blender as a standard Python 
	module imported but "cycles" module missing error occured, fixed by 
	downloading lib/win64_14/zlib folder independently.
201710172210	ver0025
	Install.bat file download zlib folder first separately to fix the error.
201710180000	ver0026
	Install.bat file more features added, checking Python, CMake installed 
	if not then alert the user with messges, EXTRA folder added to keep the 
	extra installation file.
201710181730 	ver0027
	Install.bat file SVN and Git installation checking code added.
2017101817800	ver0028
	Install.bat file check Python, SVN, Git, CMake missing, so when the 
	program is missing then ask user to decide whether to install the 
	missing program to set up project environment with the installation file
	inside EXTRA folder, if not then terminate because cannot proceed 
	without these programs installed in the system.
201710191830	ver0029
	Install.bat Visual Studio 2017 installation checking code added.
201710182145	ver0030
	Install.bat wrong Python installation file, need 64 bits Python in 
	order to proceed with installations.
201710182330	ver0031
	Install.bat error fixed savepoint.
201710192000	ver0032
	Install.bat separating to multiple sub install.bat file to organize.
201710192130	ver0033
	install_win10_x64.bat created to separate the platform compatible 
	install.bat files, since currently created install.bat is compatible 
	for Windows 10 64 bits only.
201710192300	ver0034
	Setup.bat created to separate the installation processes and 
	Blender import main project setup process. This is because the system
	doesn't recognize the installation if external program is installed 
	during the main install.bat, so i had to run install.bat twice to 
	install them properly even though the environment PATH is refreshed 
	in the batch file.
201710221830	ver0035
	Install_win10_x64.bat complete, the PATH refresh code working, it 
	didn't work before because of small syntax error. Now install work in 
	single batch file double click.
201710221950	ver0036
	Savepoint before separating "src" and "test" folder to start testing
	WYMesh class, but the unit test case cannot find the WYMesh class
	import relative path files, so i needed to move the test cases which 
	has the same relative path to the importing files.
201710231710	ver0037
	OAuth test case generator added "full code" feature, so if i have this
	"full code" section implemented then the generator generates the test 
	cases with the "full code" section only and other cell values are used
	for the Pydoc documenatations.
201710261600	ver0038	
	WYMesh class testing almost done, texture coordinate testing left.
	
201710262230	ver0039
	Main project setup.exe with ALZip self extractor executing the main 
	install_win10_x64.bat file when extracted done.
201710270130	ver0040
	Setup.exe self extractor with ALZip work on Bootcamp Windows, but 
	crashes when executed in my SONY laptop in refresh environment PATH 
	code.
201710271700	ver0041
	Savepoint before solving install batch file environment PATH 
	refresh crashing problem with Sam.
201710302240	ver0042
	New install batch file environment PATH refresh code to solve the 
	crashing problem when executed in SONY laptop. Now the install.bat	
	works properly on SONY laptop.

201710311740	ver0043
	Install batch file need to add MinGW path after installation
	manually, so install batch need the admin priviledge to add 
	MinGW/bin folder to environment variable directly with SETX command
	, to do this I needed to create a shortcut to the install batch 
	file and change the shortcut file property to start in admin mode.
	But if the shortcut file executed with admin mode, the directory
	changes automatically to C:/Windows/System32, so I needed to 
	change the shortcut property target value into a simple change
	directory command to open in current working directory even if
	executed in admin mode. Detail explained in EXTRA/GUIDE_INSTALL.txt
201711020010	ver0044
	Created local project document in project folder but found that 
	I cannot show the project progress in a nice way with text editor.
	So I stopped implementing PROJECT_DOCUMENT.txt and started 
	implementing a PROJECT_TRACKER in Google Docs.
201711031800	ver0045
	Save-point before Sam.
201711061450	ver0046
	Run batch file in admin mode error fixed, no more shortcut needed
	used "runas" command to solved the problem but user need to input 
	the admin password for the priviledge.
201711090000	ver0047
	WYMaterial testing done.
201711100050	ver0048
	WYMain, WYModel, WYModelManager, implemented to test them I needed
	__eq__ function for all the classes WYModel, WYMesh, WYMaterial, 
	WYCoordsys, WYUtil to compare them. __eq__ function implemented and 
	tested.
201711101500	ver0049
	Save-point before Sam.
201711152130	ver0050
	Export mesh and material fully tested working. Started implemented 
	import.
201711160230	ver0051
	Tkinter GUI automation started, creating and saving Blender file 
	on current working directory with just providing file name 
	tkinter app done.
201711162130	ver0052
	Tkinter GUI automation exporting models from provided Blender file
	app implmented done.

201711200230	ver0053
	Tkinter GUI atutomation importing and exporting feature working.
201711202000	ver0054
	Save-point before testing import features.
201711231400	ver0055
	Save-point before Sam. Import feature tested done. GUI import 
	export models from Blender file done.
201711270000	ver0056
	Install batch file check Blender bpy module exist inside Python 
	root directory using the XML config file so the installation
	won't be repeated when already exist.
	Run test batch file alert user when test cases are generated 
	and finisihed testing, also let the user decide whether to open
	up the file explorer to show the unit test case results and
	test cases.
201711271800	ver0057
	More automation on batch files, install.bat now skips the Blender
	setup process if the files are properly imported, and run_test.bat
	now alerts the user when done to let the user decide whether to 
	view the unit test cases results through file explorer.

201711280050	ver0058
	OAuthTestGenerator data_config_generate_make.bat batch file 
	created to use data.config XML file to generate the makefile 
	for each classes data indicated in the XML file. So the user
	is easy to implement the unit test cases.


201711290300	ver0059
	OAuthTestGenerator makefile Tkinter progress bar executed in
	parallel cannot terminate the parallel makefile job when 
	progress bar is terminated.

201711301700	ver0060

201712141700	ver0061
	WYArmatureBone started implementing.

201712200000	ver0062
	WYArmatureBone implement done. Progress bar terminates 
	the parallel makefile process when progress bar is 
	terminated by user. Now run_test.bat also checks the Blender 
	module is properly imported to Python root directory because
	there were problem that the test is ran even though 
	bpy.pyd doesn't exist.

201712200000 	ver0063
	Coding convention matching for each classes WYMesh, 
	WYMaterial, WYArmature and WYArmatureBone.
	Added new functions on WYMesh and WYMaterial to match to coding 
	conventions, need testing.
	WYArmature and WYArmatureBone implementation done need testing.
	FuncDefRetriever tool created to view the function definition 
	for each class files to view the difference between code 
	conventions.

201712282030	ver0064 
	Provide user input to let the user decide whether to fresh 
	download blender-git folder or decompress from ZIP file inside
	EXTRA folder instead to save the time to download the files.

201712290030	ver0065 
	Project uninstall_win10_x64.bat tested. SlikSVN and Python can 
	be uninstalled through its installer exe, but others i needed to
	delete the root directory manually, so the environment variable 
	are the problem but decided to ignore them because it will take
	too long to handle them.

201801022040	ver0065
	WYArmature + WYArmatueBone implement done, not tested.
	WYArmature import export through WYModelManager working 
	without any mesh mapped onto them, tested through
	WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR\WY_PROJ_BLENDER_EDITOR\MAIN\
	src\main\WYMain\test.blend

201801022040	ver0066
	Implementing WYArmature import in WYModelManager by hands 
	working, not tested.

201801081900	ver0067
	Implementing WYArmature export in WYModelManager by hands 
	working, not tested.
	OAuthTestCaseGenerator main.bat has changed 
	OAuthTestCaseGenerator user interface implemented to let the 
	user choose the classes indicated inside data.config to test 
	with. Progress bar now calculates the size properly also can
	now load prorgess bar for each class operation not reading
	data.config directly.
	OAuthTestCaseGenerator each class operation is implemented 
	by passing the class name as command line arguments, 
	if nothing is passed then everything is ran by default.
	Ready for testing WYArmature.

201801090100	ver0068
	Fixed some errors occurred on code changes in WYMesh, 
	WYArmatureBone and WYModel.
	Final ready to test WYArmature.
	
201801232330	ver0069
	WYArmature import and export implemented and tested.

201802010400	ver0070
	WYAnimation implemented and tested.
	WYAnimation export implemented.

201802212030	ver0071
	WYModelManager animation export import testing done.

201803050030	ver0072
	BlenderTestPanel custom side panel tool script added to 
	WYMain folder to merge the project to test export import 
	codes with custom addons for automation.
